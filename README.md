# My R scripts

Currently with R I'm mostly focused on visualtisation of data - so here some scrpits which I use in work.

* [Practical use of hydroGOF modelling statistics analyses](hydroGOF_modelling_stat_analyses.R) - I used this script for checking the basic statistics for calibration and validation period for hydrology model. For the proper use, you need simulated and observed data.

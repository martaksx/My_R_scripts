# My R scripts :sunglasses:

Currently I'm mostly focused on visualtisation of data in R or peforming basic data analyses - so here some scrpits which I use in work and want to share - hope they can be useful for somebody :wink:

* [Practical use of hydroGOF modelling statistics analyses](hydroGOF_modelling_stat_analyses.R) - I used this script for checking the basic statistics (for discharge) for calibration and validation period for hydrology model. For the proper use, you need simulated and observed data.
